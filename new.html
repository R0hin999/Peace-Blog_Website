    <p class="p first-para">To most people peace refers to the absence of violence. But it means that you have enough understanding to keep yourself strong and calm in the face of stress or any problem .

    <p class="p secondpara">Everyone knows that stress is not good ; it leads to anxiety and other health issues . Being busy is good but having spare time to slow down and enjoy life can provide imense relief to mind and can recover mental fatigue . Having inner peace is as important as keeping you body   fit   and   soul   healthy . We all  go   through   good and bad times ;  some we cherish , some we regret .

It is the high time for everyone to learn the art of being in peace . </p>

        You might think you can only be in peace when you don't have problems to deal with or after achieving some goals , but thats not true . Infact , its the other way around .And it is not necessary to be a buddhist monk or sadhu in order to be in peace. But if we will spend our  endless time in thinking about things we dont like about ourselves and past regrets , we will never feel peaceful. Nobody is perfect , removing all expectations will let you appreciate your life as is .when you learn to accept your flaws instead of magnifying them , you create a healthy and peaceful environment for yourself .  No doubt its not that easy to have inner peace , but once you get hang of it , it will be a piece of cake .

 <h2 class="Art-header">5.Hobby</h2>   
 
 <img class='Art-img'src="art.png" width="400px"  >
 <p class="Art-p" >Find yourself a hobby which is different from your daily work so that it can give you peace . For me its painting it relaxes my mind and reduces my stress . Whenever i go for Vacations i bring a sketchbook with me so that i can do sketching . The process of making any kind of artwork is itself such therapeutic and wonderful thing . It requires creative and critical thinking skills to decide what to draw or sketch , making concept art , deciding the colors to use , blending the colors . It also sharpens the mind through conceptual visualization and implementation and boosts memory skills . If you dont want to make artworks in traditonal style as it takes lots of efforts so you can make artworks digitally with the help of softwares it just makes process easy and save lots of time and money .  I personally use Adobe Photoshop for making digital art . Digital Art is beginner friendly too so you can make really wonderful artworks with just minimum efforts even if you do mistakes in it you can just simply undo . So find a hobby that gives you inner peace .
